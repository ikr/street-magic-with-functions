# Street magic with functions

That's the talk I gave at JSZurich on 22.02.2011.

## Abstract

Of all the contemporary mainstream languages JavaScript is probably the one most influenced by functional programming. Discovering the foundations of functional approach may therefore be greatly beneficial to anyone writing JavaScript code. Besides, grasping those fundamentals often yields moments of true aesthetic pleasure and, wellâ€¦ fun. Is it possible to iterate without loops? Can one recurse without really recursing? How to fake Haskel's lazy evaluation? Why should we care? The answers are coming.
