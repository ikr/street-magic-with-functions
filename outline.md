# Street magic with functions

## Abstract

Of all the contemporary mainstream languages JavaScript is probably the one most influenced by functional programming. Discovering the foundations of functional approach may therefore be greatly beneficial to anyone writing JavaScript code. Besides, grasping those fundamentals often yields moments of true aesthetic pleasure and, wellâ€¦ fun. Is it possible to iterate without loops? Can one recurse without really recursing? How to fake Haskel's lazy evaluation? Why should we care? The answers are coming.

## Points

* Computability

* 2 groups of computation models:
	* "Imperative": Turing machine, random access machine, finite state machine, pushdown automaton
	* "Functional": lambda calculus, combinatory logic, mu-recursive functions, Markov algorithm
	
* Loops
	* Imperative exponentiation
	* Exponentiation via linear recursion
